## My story

I studied **Computer Engineering** at the *Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia* and graduated in 2021.  
After that, I completed a **Masterâ€™s degree in Big Data Analytics** at the same university, which sparked my interest in cloud technologies.  
Since then, Iâ€™ve been working as a **DevOps Engineer**, driven by a strong passion for cloud platforms, automation and infrastructure as code.
